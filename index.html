        <p>Football is my favorite hobby. It is also a famous sport all over the world. By playing football, we can keep our body strong, fit and flexible, to play football is a good exercise and good for health.I think football is the best sport I have ever played or watched. Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful. No one man can win a football game.He may make a big tackle or a diving catch, but without him and the other 10 players on the field he can not win a game.<br /><br /> A football player can not be selfish and put himself before his team. "One man practicing sportsmanship is far better than a hundred teaching it" said legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne. </p></section>
